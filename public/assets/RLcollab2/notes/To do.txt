Bugs

-- code to add that currently breaks game

**POSSIBLY DO
Change stat order

gtrabbit: you might also have a weapon that adds a bonus to dualWield
gtrabbit: and then you might have a passive skill that also gives a bonus
gtrabbit: equipment and skills give bonuses as flat numbers
gtrabbit: so like, +5, +9, whatever
unkind: ya
gtrabbit: but if the status applies a percentage, then the order in which we apply the various modifiers matters
gtrabbit: so. lets say base is 20
unkind: ah
gtrabbit: then equipment bonuses give 5
gtrabbit: and skills give 10
unkind: order would be base + passives * status percent + equipment at the end
