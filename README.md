# JavaScript Roguelike

Classic rogue-like gameplay, built using the [ROT.js](https://github.com/ondras/rot.js) library. 

## Getting Started

The game rests inside a React application, which is used to create the user interface. As the game is always in development, the game is only playable by launching the React server, which runs in Node.js. Before moving on, make sure you have Node.js installed. 

Next, open a terminal window to the root directory of this repository then:

1. `npm install` // this installs all dependencies
2. `npm start` // this launches the server on your localhost and opens a browser window to view the proper port. 

From there, proceed like any other game.

## Goals

Ultimately, we intend for this to be a full-featured game, including an actual story and everything. 

Upcoming Features:

+ Totally new UI
+ Actual graphics
+ Absurdly complex magic system
+ Event-based alignment system
+ Fun!

## Acknowledgements

Obviously, thanks to Ondrej Zara (Ondras) for the ROT.js library. 

Less obviously, thanks to Dominic of [Coding Cookies](http://www.codingcookies.com/) for putting together the tutorial upon which much of the original structure for this game is based. It should be mentioned that this tutorial was in turn based upon [a prior Tutorial in Java by Trystan](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html). Though we have expanded massively from those roots, I could not have got off the ground without their guidance. 

We'd also like to acknowledge our inspirations for game design, which, for this particular game, include:

+ ADoM (Ancient Domains of Mystery)
+ ToME (Tales of Maj-Eyal)
+ Elona
+ Moongate (A very old MUD) 
+ and many others. 

Also, you may have heard of [React](https://reactjs.org/). (It's actually an awful fit for this project, but I needed the practice....)
